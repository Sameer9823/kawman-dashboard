/**
 * How much of the organization's data a role can see, independent of
 * whether they hold the base "X.view" permission (which only gates
 * whether the page/action is reachable at all — see
 * lib/permissions-data.ts). This is the missing piece: today every
 * CRM service function filters queries by organizationId only, so any
 * role with e.g. "leads.view" (which includes SALES_EXECUTIVE and even
 * VIEWER) receives every lead in the org, identical to what ADMIN sees.
 *
 * - 'ALL'        — SUPER_ADMIN / ADMIN: no extra filter, full org visibility.
 * - 'DEPARTMENT' — MANAGER / SALES_MANAGER: records owned by anyone in
 *                  their department (falls back to 'OWN' if they have no
 *                  department set).
 * - 'OWN'        — everyone else: only records where ownerId === user.id,
 *                  plus anything explicitly granted via ResourceGrant
 *                  (see getGrantedResourceIds below).
